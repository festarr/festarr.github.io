This file was a quick static page with 2 links.
Each link forwarded the user to 1 of 4 random surveys.

This page was created in order to have 1 URL be physically printed in postcards that were mailed to a target audience

We needed data collection for all 4 surveys but could only print 1 URL in the postcard

The 4 surveys are found in English and Spanish. Two buttons were created for each language, so in total there are 8 surveys
